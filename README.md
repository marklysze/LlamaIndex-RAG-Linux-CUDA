# RAG with LlamaIndex - Nvidia CUDA + Linux + Word documents + Local LLM
## Now using LlamaIndex Core

These notebooks demonstrate the use of LlamaIndex for Retrieval Augmented Generation using Linux and Nvidia's CUDA.

Environment:
- Linux (I'm running Ubuntu 22.04)
- Conda environment (I'm using Miniconda)
- CUDA (environment is setup for 12.3)
- Visual Studio Code (to run the Jupyter Notebooks)
- Nvidia RTX 3090
- 64GB RAM (Can be run with less)
- LLMs - Mistral 7B, Llama 2 13B Chat, Orca 2 13B, Yi 34B, Mixtral 8x7B, Neural 7B, Phi-2, SOLAR 10.7B - Quantized versions

** IMPORTANT 2024-02-22: This has been updated with LlamaIndex Core (v0.10.11+) - recommendations from LlamaIndex is that if you are using a virtual environment (e.g. conda or venv) that you start from scratch with a new environment. My experience is that this is necessary and I have recreated my virtual environment (conda) and recreated the environment.yml

Your Data:
- Add Word documents to the "Data" folder for the RAG to use

Package versions:
- See the installation section below where you can install a conda environment with all the working package versions

Local LLMs:
- Put your downloaded LLM files into a "Models" folder
- I downloaded the quantized versions of the LLMs from huggingface.co - thanks to TheBloke who provided these quantized GGUF models. You can use higher quantized versions or different LLMs - just be aware that LLMs may have different prompt templates so be sure to use the correct prompt template format (e.g. Llama 2 requires a specific format for best results - see the Llama code for a function that creates the prompt).

To tell if you are utilising your Nvidia graphics card, in your command prompt, while in the conda environment, type "nvidia-smi". You should see your graphics card and when you're notebook is running you should see your utilisation increase.

# Prerequisites

These have been run with Nvidia CUDA version 12.3 installed on the system. It has not been tested with older versions.
Install the CUDA Toolkit from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (see Base Installer steps)

# Installation

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository
3. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/marklysze/LlamaIndex-RAG-Linux-CUDA
```
4. Navigate to the repository directory
```
cd LlamaIndex-RAG-Linux-CUDA
```
5. Create the Conda environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
6. Activate the Conda environment
```
conda activate LlamaIndexRAGLinux
```
5. Run Visual Studio Code
```
code .
```
6. Choose a a Jupyter Notebook file to open
7. On the top-right you may need to choose the newly created kernel. In the top-right if it says "Select Kernel", click it and then click on "Python environment..." and then "LlamaIndexRAGLinux".
8. Download the corresponding model files from HuggingFace (links above) and save them in a **Models** folder
9. Run the Jupyter Notebook


# Performance
I noticed a considerable improvement in the loading time of models under Linux than under WSL2 in Windows. What would take minutes in WSL2 under Windows would take seconds in Linux (on the same computer). This made working with these Linux files more time efficient.

> 
> In summary, this story is about Thundertooth's journey through time, his acceptance in a futuristic society, and his role as an instrumental figure in uniting different eras while working together with other extraordinary beings to overcome challenges that threaten their newfound home.


Q: Who was the main protagonist?

> In this particular context provided, we do not have enough information to identify a specific main protagonist. The given sources discuss various events and characters, such as Thundertooth, Mayor Grace, Lumina, Echo, Sapphire, Ignis, and others. However, without further details or a clear narrative, it is impossible for me to determine the primary character in these excerpts.

```
Interestingly, it's the only model that wasn't 100% convinced that Thundertooth was the protagonist, though it did decide to go with them. Reading the context LlamaIndex provided, I think Thundertooth would be the protagonist.

On a separate note, LlamaIndex retrieves the section on the children when asked this question so perhaps if it found a more relevant section and presented it to the model, such as the first paragraph of the story, it would be clearer who the protagonist is.
